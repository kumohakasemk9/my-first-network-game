My first Multiplayer game
=====

This is incomplete project for my first multiplayer game. 
I thought I want to make a game like League of Legends, 
using my friend's OCs, but I gave up 
Some files missing in the repository: 
1. server/datas.c
2. client/images/*
 
1 is for user database. You need to write structure having user data. 
2 is for player's character image. Once I tried with friend's OC and 
I am not going to redistribute that.
